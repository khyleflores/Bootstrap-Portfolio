# My Portfolio

## Description 

A portfolio of work has been created so I can showcase my skills to employers looking for front end programmers. On this portfolio, details about me, my work and my contacts are listed. It is important that I am able to create this portfolio as well as being able to connect the projects I have deployed to this website so that prospective employers may view my works and assess my skills. This will present evidence of my relevant skills and abilities. This portfolio has been made with the use of Bootstrap CSS Framework.

By doing this project, I was able to apply some skills I have learned during the Week 2 and 3 Bootcamp - media queries, CSS variables and Bootstrap framework. As I don't have enough deployed applications, I have used some sample images linking it back to the same website. 
I will be able to update this every time as I continue to complete more projects and deploy more applications. There are 2 projects in the website directly linked to its deployed application.
